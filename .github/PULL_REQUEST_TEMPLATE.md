Do you have any remaining questions about this deliverable?:
I couldn't figure out how to edit the button itself after adding it in. Wanted to center it and make it bigger, but it didn't seem to work in CSS unless I was doing something wrong.
I also couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make the images stay aligned in the right spots without making the images too big and too small.
I couldn't remember how to put the font directly over the images in the center.
