"I'm pretty happy with the way my final product looks on my own full-screen. That being said, it is not a responsive design and would not do well on a browser that isnt full screen and a laptop. I honestly spent a lot of time on this and I'm not even sure I did it right I just found ways that made it work...sorta. Games were fun but putting the concepts into use was a lot harder. Did a good amount of googling but I do still have questions and would love feedback and suggestions because, again, I feel like I did it wrong. Visually they are very similar but I just couldn't figure out how to get that slim border around my button. Better luck next time!"
