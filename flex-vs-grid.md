# Flexbox vs Grid
## Flexbox
### Flexbox seems to align objects relative to each other on the page. It also uses the actual page itself (start, end, center, etc) to align and order objects
## Grid
### Grid establishes a grid and then aligns and positions objects along it. It doesn't matter where the other objects are on the page. There is no "center" or other relative terms either
## Similarities and Differences
### Both systems allow for precise positioning of objects. The order that things were written in the source code is overwritten by these positioning systems.
### Flexbox feels more "organic" and flexible than Grid. It seems like it would be good when a responsive design is needed, such as for mobile. Grid seems more fixed. It seems like it would be best for layouts where the page needs to have a set "look," like a news site, or a desktop social media webpage.
