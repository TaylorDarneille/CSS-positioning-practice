Flex vs. Grid



Both flexboxs and grids are useful tools for creating dynamic and responsive web pages. The flexbox and grid can be used so that items within the webpage will maintain a pleasing arrangement no matter the viewport size. For both tools the general layout and arrangement will stay relatively the same oexcept in certain situations. Items in a flexbox will maintain their positions and relationships to one another in all scenarios except in scenarios when wrap is being used. In these scenarios items may be "pushed," to a new line. Flexboxes can be used to center the content within it, evenly space the items or stack them to any side of the box.  With grid the amount of rows and columns and their sizes are predetermined therefore items will not be pushed to different locations. For grids the sizes or each grid cell can be dynamic if using percentage for fracture to set their sizes.
