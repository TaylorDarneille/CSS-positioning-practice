In grid, there are columns and rows that are specified to different length values set in percentages, fr or pixels. In grid, you can specify where to start and end. Grid uses negative values to count from opposite direction while flexbox uses negative values to rearrange items. Span value can be used in grid. In flexbox, there is no specified columns or rows. In flexbox you can make the columns and rows wide apart or close together based on the spacing in between or the space around. There is also text wrap in flexbox.
