Prompt: Write a paragraph or two comparing/contrasting flexbox and grid in this file. What did you learn about the two? How are they the same? How are they different?

Flexbox and grid are two modern CSS tools that both provide a solution to one of the challenges with layout (specifically alignment) consistency across varying browsers. They make website layout much more versatile and easier to write. 

Beyond their similarities, flexbox is single-axisâ€“oriented meaning it is useful for one-dimensional layout whereas grid, hence its namesake, supports two-dimension layouts. With grid, you're able to divide screens in rows and columns allowing for more sleek, versailte, and modern website layouts.
