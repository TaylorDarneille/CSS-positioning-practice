Seemed to be a pretty creative way to learn how learn commands for positioning. The main difference between the two as far as I could tell is that the grid garden is just that, a grid. The lines were visible and you could see exactly where you were positioning the water/carrots. In the flexbox, the idea was still the same in a grid type formation but without the lines. Everything between the two seemed to be defined in rows and columns. The main difference between the two that I noticed was that the commands to enter in the CSS was that in the grid garden the commands mostly seemed to start with "grid", or "rows" and "columns. In the flexbox, the commands all seemed to start with "justify", "align", or "flex".
