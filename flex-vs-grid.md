Flexbox and CSS grid can both be used to create structured pages that look nice and organized. The main difference that I see is that Flexbot can only arrange within a row or a column while CSS grid can work changing both at once. When moving the flexbox items they are one unit that can be wraped compressed and organized within the column or row area. The CSS grid creates a grid that can guide the items to their position anywhere on the website page.
