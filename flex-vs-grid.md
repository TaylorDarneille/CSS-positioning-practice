Both flexbox and grid are helpful but for different situations. Flexbox is aimed more towards columns and rows, where as the grid is focused on squares or a grid across the web page. I would use flexbox to coordinate multiple items across rows and large portions of the webpage. I would then go in and get a bit more specific with my grid, I will choose selected portions of the webpage and move them around to my liking.
