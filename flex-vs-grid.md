Flexbox and grid are both ways to arrange content on your page. Flexbox uses properties to adjust the spacing between and around elements, and you can adjust the order and direction they are displayed. With grid, you definte rows and columns in the needed sizes and then tell the cells how many rows/columns to take up. Both of them fix a common problem in CSS with arranging elements on the page.
