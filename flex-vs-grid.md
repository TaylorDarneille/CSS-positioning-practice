 I generally found flex to be easier to use than grid. However I would have to practice using both to really understand what the commands are doing and how to use them more effectively.  I think matching the color of the frogs and the color of the lily pads also helped me visualize the reverse-row or reverse-column commands.I think matching the color of the frogs and the color of the lily pads also helped me visualize the reverse-row or reverse-column commands.
