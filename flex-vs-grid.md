# Flexbox is used for laying out items in a single demension as a row or a column. Grid is for layout of items in two dimensions- rows and columns. Grid for me can be compared to as excel with multiple values and columns as used. Flexbox are item that is moved around in a single space. from left to right. 
## Flexbox was easier with centering and spacing. Grid had multiple things happening that did not make sense to me. 
## Both used to position pictures and text right where they belong and creats more center and spacing.
