Flexbox and grid are both used to position elements. They both can achieve a plethora of the same results while also having separating characteristics that may lead you to using either in different ways.

Flexbox mainly positions elements by only moving them in a one-dimensional direction. This means it's mainly used for a position change in either a row or a column, not typically both at the same time. Flexbox also has a larger compatibility than grid currently for most browsers. You can wrap elements to make them look two dimensional, but bear the consequence of less "customization." 

CSS Grid positions elements by moving them in a two-dimensional direction. You can move elements either by a row or column. The grid is great for overall page structure and positioning elements. Grid offers a little more flexibility in this case vs. Flexbox.
