# Differences between CSS Grid & Flexbox

## CSS Grid vs. Flexbox
### While both Grid and Flexbox are both used to create layouts, I learned that there are a few main differences between CSS Grid & Flexbox.

#### CSS Grid allows developers to control sizing and positioning of elements across two dimensions: columns & rows. This is most useful when alignment of content is desired in both dimensions. Flexbox aligns elements along only one dimension at a time, either columns or rows. This makes CSS Grid a bit more flexible but Flexbox allows fine-tuning of alignments within the single dimension. Finally, CSS Grib works best on a larger scale while Flexbox works on smaller scale dimension.
