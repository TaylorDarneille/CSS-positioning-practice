# The difference between Flexbox and grid that I saw is that in flexbox i was able to wrap whatever I am working on to the next row. With grid, I would have to give it a different row for the others to go to the next row. Another difference is that with grid, you are using an actual grid. Flexbox equals no grid.

## The similarities may be the fact that both move things to different places on the screen.  I notice that when using both, you are just telling the computer what position you want the object to go to.

### Just Trying to see if I am pushing correctly.

#### Im sorry! This has nothing to do with the assignment. Im just glad I am finally being able to push.
