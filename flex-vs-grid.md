Flex and Grid allow us to position elements in our HTML using CSS.  This similarity between the two ways of positioning elements allow us to position elements in terms of the page, meaning it allow us to place elements based on the dimensions of the page.  But Grid CSS code lets us give static values to position our elements even if the page is resized.   Another difference between the two is that Flex gives us the ability to order the elements on our page  using the order property in Flex but in Grid we can only change the start our end place of our element we can even increase the size of the element unlike Flex where you can only compress elements to a line or wrap them so they aren't all on the single line.
