Flexbox and grid are both a type of CSS styling that work with display. Grid allows for my specific value inputs while flexbox seems that its more determined by loose concepts such as left/right/top/bottom/center. With grid tyling you can establish different sizing for the template and from there the ordering and placement of items are more determined by number placement  within rows and columns. Another big difference between the two is that flexbox is single-axis oriented and grid optimizes 2-dimensional layouts(cells can take up multiple rows and columns).
