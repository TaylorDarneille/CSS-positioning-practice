# Flexbox vs Grid

Both the flexbox and grid are tools used to position HTML elements on a page. Both appear to be attempts to optimize placement of elements in relation to each other without the need to account for the relationships between individual elements as meticulously as may be needed when using CSS positioning properties.

While both do a lot of the work for you in optimizing the placement of elements within a space, flexbox and grid seem optimized for different approaches. Flexbox seems to be more useful for manipulating a group of elements in a uniform way within a space, whereas grid allows for more specification in how space is divided, giving you more versatility in the exact placement of individual elements relative to each other.
