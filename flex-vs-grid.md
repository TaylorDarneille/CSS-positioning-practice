## Part 3: 

Use the [command line](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/01-workflow/01readme) to create a new file in this repository called `flex-vs-grid.md`. Write a paragraph or two comparing/contrasting flexbox and grid in this file. What did you learn about the two? How are they the same? How are they different? 

Flexbox is a CSS tool that allows for the manipulation of the position of items on your webpage. Using display:flex and its various commands allows the user to align items to specific parts of the page or change the spacing between or around them.
CSS Grid allows the user to divide their webpage into grids, making the placement of items on their webpage more streamlined. Using Grid, the user can divide their page into an unlimited amount/size of rows and columns to help place their items in the desired position.
Both are similar in that they result in style and postiion manipulation, but flexbox requires the user to specify if they are placing objects in a row or column orientation while Grid allows the user to manipulate the grid/item using both the row and column orientation.
